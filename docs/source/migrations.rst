rstcheck v5 to rstcheck-core v1 (rc1)
-------------------------------------

**Subject to change till final release**

With version 6 the whole code base was restructured and the core library was moved into a
separate repository. With it the whole open library API has changed. A simple migration is not
possible. Please see the :ref:`api:API` section or open an issue if you have open questions.
